# CMPT 825: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
This directory contains solutions written for assignments for a class, 
CMPT 825: Natural Language Processing at Simon Fraser University, Fall 2018.
Each assignment was a group project. The following are descriptions of each
assignment:

## hw0: 
Warm-up assignment for familiarizing with submitting assignments through
Gitlab.

## hw2: Decipherment
The description of the assignment provided by the class is in `README.md`.
My contribution to the project is documented in `doc/README.hbadrulh`.
The group's development process and solution are documented in `decipher
.ipynb`.

## hw3: Phrasal chunking

The group's development process and solution are documented in `chunk.ipynb`.

## hw4: Word alignment
The description of the assignment provided by the class is in `README.md`.
My contribution to the project is documented in `doc/README.hbadrulh`.
The group's development process and solution are documented in `align.ipynb`.

## project
For the open-ended project component of the class we implemented a system of
genre-sensitive text summarization. Instead of using one text summary model 
to summarize any text input, our system consists of multiple text summary
 models, and each model is trained on specific text genres. When an input text 
is given, the model to be used is chosen based on topic modelling of the
 input text.

The group's development process and solution are documented in `project.ipynb`.
