Gustavo Felhberg, gfelhber, Homework 3

Contributions:

1 - Implemented the improvement for the Baseline using the averaged perceptron algorithm described in Sarkar 2011. I have implemented the more efficient version (page 38). The results are good, reaching 93.52 as the F1 score using the full dataset for training.

This implementation was chosen to be submitted as the official result of this homework.
